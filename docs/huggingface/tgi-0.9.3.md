Clients will send input sequences and ask to generate `max_new_tokens` on top. With a value of `1512` users can send either a prompt of `1000` and ask for `512` new tokens, or send a prompt of `1` and ask for `1511` max_new_tokens. The larger this value, the larger amount each request will be in your RAM and the less effective batching can be.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| WAITING_SERVED_RATIO     |             1.2             | This represents the ratio of waiting queries vs running queries where you want to start considering pausing the running queries to include the waiting ones into the same batch. `waiting_served_ratio=1.2` Means when 12 queries are waiting and there's only 10 queries left in the current batch we check if we can fit those 12 waiting queries into the batching strategy, and if yes, then batching happens delaying the 10 running queries by a `prefill` run.This setting is only applied if there is room in the batch as defined by `max_batch_total_tokens`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| MAX_BATCH_TOTAL_TOKENS   |            16000            | ***IMPORTANT*** This is one critical control to allow maximum usage of the available hardware. This represents the total amount of potential tokens within a batch. When using padding (not recommended) this would be equivalent of `batch_size` * `max_total_tokens`. However in the non-padded (flash attention) version this can be much finer. For `max_batch_total_tokens=1000`, you could fit `10` queries of `total_tokens=100` or a single query of `1000` tokens. Overall this number should be the largest possible amount that fits the remaining memory (after the model is loaded). Since the actual memory overhead depends on other parameters like if you're using quantization, flash attention or the model implementation, text-generation-inference cannot infer this number automatically.                                                                                                                                                              |
| MAX_WAITING_TOKENS       |             20              | This setting defines how many tokens can be passed before forcing the waiting queries to be put on the batch (if the size of the batch allows for it). New queries require 1 `prefill` forward, which is different from `decode` and therefore you need to pause the running batch in order to run `prefill` to create the correct values for the waiting queries to be able to join the batch.With a value too small, queries will always "steal" the compute to run `prefill` and running queries will be delayed by a lot.With a value too big, waiting queries could wait for a very long time before being allowed a slot in the running batch. If your server is busy that means that requests that could run in ~2s on an empty server could end up running in ~20s because the query had to wait for 18s.This number is expressed in number of tokens to make it a bit more "model" agnostic, but what should really matter is the overall latency for end users. |
